A highly flocculent Norwegian kveik ale strain with an astoundingly wide temperature range and little change in flavor across the range, Hotheadâ„¢ is clean enough for both American and English styles. It has a unique honey-like aroma with overripe mango which is complementary to modern, fruity hops. Temperature control is unnecessary with this strain. Non-phenolic and no fusels, even at higher temperatures.
