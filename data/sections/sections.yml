  text2: We’re here to make it easy to focus on brewing. Pro pitches are made-to-order, yielding the freshest, healthiest yeast at the height of its performance. Brewers order by pitch rate and batch size for precise counts, transparent pricing and overall consistency. Any strain, in any quantity, at any time of year is custom propped fresh for your brew in 7-10 days. We carry all the strains you’re used to working with and the innovative strains you’d like to.

## About Page Sections

- text: Omega Yeast produces fresh, high quality and pitch-ready liquid yeast for Probrewers and Homebrewers. We're a dedicated crew located in Chicago and St. Louis—a handful of microbiologists, homebrewers, professional brew staff and craft beer fans who have made it our express purpose to make brewing easier and better for everyone.
  text2: We believe the best yeast is the freshest yeast. That's why our Probrew pitches are always custom made-to-order, and delivered the date you need them. And Homebrewers can find a selection of our vigorously healthy yeast at a local homebrew shop near you.
  text3: We believe in experimentation, innovation and questioning the status quo, which is why we produce over 75 strains, including common workhorse varieties and several unique ones that you can't find anywhere else. Our proprietary propagation method generates metabolically strong yeast cells, with consistent fermentation and optimized cell counts.
  text4: As much as we love our yeast, we're just as proud of our people and service. We promise to make it easy for you to focus on brewing because we’re always here for you. Check out our resources or email us any questions—we're here to help.
